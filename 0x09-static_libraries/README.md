HOLBERTON SCHOOL= 0X09 C- Static Libraries

Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

    What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
    Basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm

Requirements
C

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
    You are allowed to use _putchar
    You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
    Don’t forget to push your header file

Bash

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    All your files should end with a new line (why?)
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
    All your files must be executable

0.Create the static library libmy.a containing all the functions listed below:
If you haven’t coded all of the above functions create empty ones with the right prototype.
Don’t forget to push your main.h file to your repository. It should at least contain all the prototypes of the above functions.

1.Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

2.Write a blog post on C static libraries. It should cover:

    Why use libraries
    How they work
    How to create them
    How to use them

Your posts should have examples and at least one picture, at the top. Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn, and share it at least on LinkedIn.

When done, please add all urls below (blog post, LinkedIn post, etc.)

Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings
